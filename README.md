This is a program for generate a random password based on criteria which is selected. When the button is clicked, 
it will generate a password. The password length can be selected up to 128 characters. At least one character 
type have to be selected. I did not use "prompt", "alert" & "confirm" function since it will be more clear an web UI and 
simple select on the web page.
